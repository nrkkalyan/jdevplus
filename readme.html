<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enthuware JDevPlus Sample Application</span><br>
</div>
<br>
This is a sample application that poses similar situation and
challenges as the real SCJD assignment. Please remember that this is a
SAMPLE application and is not a solution for your real assignment
although you can learn how various issues can be dealt with.
<br>


<br>



The details of the application and the requirements are described in docs\instructionsUC.html




<br>



<br>



<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">How to execute the program</span></big><br>



The entry point into the application is through the class <span style="font-weight: bold;">com.unitedcaterers.ApplicationMain</span>. <br>


<br>



You can either run this class after extracting the contents of runme.jar or as discribed below:

<br>



<ol>



  <li>Let's say you have extracted the contents of the jar file to <span style="font-weight: bold;">c:\jdevplus\</span>. You should see the following files in this folder:
    <br>



    
    
    
    <ol>



      <li>javadoc : Contains the generated JavaDoc files.</li>



      <li>src &nbsp;: Contains the source code of the project.</li>



      <li>readme.html &nbsp;: This file.</li>



      <li>ucdb.db : The database file.</li>



      <li>userguide.txt : &nbsp;Help on how to use the application.</li>



      <li>applicationdesign.html : Important information about the architecture and design of this application.</li>



      <li>instructionsuc.html : The instruction file based on which
this project was developed. This is similar to the file that you might
have received as a part of your SCJD assignement.</li>



      <li>version.txt : Contains the version information of the Java compiler and platform used.</li>



      <li>runme.jar : Contains the class files with appropriate manifest information.</li>
      <li>jdevplus-netbeans : This folder contains netbeans project files. Please see details below.</li>



    
    
    
    </ol>



    <br>



  </li>



  <li>Run the server. Open up a DOS (command/shell) prompt and go to the above mentioned directory. Execute the following:<br>



    <br>



    <span style="font-weight: bold;">c:\jdevplus\&gt;java -jar runme.jar rmiserver</span>
OR
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">c:\</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">jdevplus</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">\&gt;java -jar runme.jar socketserver</span>
    <br>



    <br>



(The server starts RMI registry itself on port 1099, so you don't have
to start it.)
It will popup a dialog asking for the properties such as database file.
Default values will be populated and will work without any change.&nbsp;<br>



  </li>



  <li>Run the client.
Open up a new DOS (command/shell) window and go to same directory. Now execute:
    <br>



    <br>



    <span style="font-weight: bold;">c:\</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">jdevplus</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">\&gt;java -jar runme.jar rmiclient</span> or
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">c:\</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">jdevplus</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">\&gt;java -jar runme.jar socketclient</span>&nbsp;<br>



    <br>



It will popup a dialog asking for the properties such as hostname and
port. Default values will be populated and will work without any
change.
    <br>



    <br>



The client can also be run in local mode. In this mode, the Database
server and the Client run in the same JVM without any networking logic.
You can run it using the following command line:<br>



    <br>



    <span style="font-weight: bold;">

c:\</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">jdevplus</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">\&gt;java -jar runme.jar alone</span>

    <br>



    <br>



It will popup a dialog asking for the properties such as database file.
Default values will be populated and will work without any change.</li>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Netbeans Project</span><br>
<br>
The folder <span style="font-weight: bold;">jdevplus-netbeans</span>
contains files specific to NetBeans. It has nothing to do with the the
assignment. To use it, open Netbeans IDE, click on File-&gt; Open
Project menu, and browse to this folder. Netbeans will recognize this
as a valid project and open it. Use "clean and build" to build the
project.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note : </span>The project files assume
that your root folder (the folder where you have extracted the contents
of rmisocket.zip) to c:\jdevplus folder.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Eclipse Project</span><br>
The directory structure of the source code is compatible with Ecplise.
&nbsp;Just do New -&gt;Java Project and select "Create Project from
Existing Source", to open the project in Eclipse.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">There is extensive documentation within the code itself. So please do
check it out and in case of any doubt, do not hesitate to contact us at
