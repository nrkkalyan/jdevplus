<h2>
<a name="what_this"></a>Application Overview</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

United Caterers (UC) is a consortium of caterers of New York.
They take requests from customers for catering to Engagement, Wedding, Funeral, and
other such parties and offer a range of caterers operating in the vicinity.
Customers call United Caterers and tell them about their requirement in terms
of number of people in the party and location. The customer service rep (CSR) at UC,
will use this application to see all the caterers meeting the given criteria and then book one caterer.

<p>You are given a non-relational data file that contains some data in the format
described below. UC already has a some custom back end applications that manipulate the
data file so you need to work with the same datafile and thus you need to write the code
that can manipulate the data file.

</p>
<p>The new application, using the existing data file format, must allow a CSR to generate
a list of caterers that match a the customer's criteria.

</p>
<h3>
Things to do</h3>

The following are the high level features that must be implemented:
<ul>

  <li>
A client program with a graphical user interface that connects to the database</li>

  <li>
A data access system that provides record locking and a flexible search
mechanism</li>

  <li>
Network server functionality for the database system</li>

</ul>

The work involves a number of design choices that have to be made. In all
such cases, the following principles should be applied.
<h4>
Clarity and Maintainability</h4>

<dl>

  <dd>
A clear design, such as will be readily understood by junior programmers,
will be preferred to a complex one, even if the complex one is a little
more efficient. Code complexity, including nesting depth, argument passing,
and the number of classes and interfaces, should be reasonable.</dd>

  <dd>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h4>
Documentation</h4>

<dl>

  <dd>
    <ul>

      <li>Use javadoc for each element of the public interface of each class.
      </li>
      <li>Create a full suite of documentation for the classes of the completed project.
This must be generated using the tool "javadoc" and must be in HTML format. Provide
javadoc documentation for all classes you write.
      </li>
      <li>You must also provide basic user documentation. This should be sufficient to
allow a user who is familiar with the broad purpose of the project to use
the application. This documentation must be in <b>one</b> of these three formats:
        <ul>

          <li>
HTML</li>

          <li>
Plain text (not a wordprocessor format)</li>

          <li>
Within the application as a help system.</li>

        </ul>

      </li>
    </ul>

  </dd>
</dl>

<h4>
Correctness</h4>

<dt>
Your project must conform to this specification.&nbsp; Features that deviate
from specification will not receive full credit.&nbsp; You will not receive
extra credit points for work beyond the requirements of the specification.</dt>

<h4>
Use of Standard Elements</h4>

<dl>
Use of functionality provided by the core Java classes will be preferred
to your own implementation of that functionality, unless there is a specific
advantage to providing your own implementation.
</dl>

<h2>
<a name="arch"></a>Overall Architecture</h2>

<h3>
Major Components</h3>

The main architecture of the application must be a traditional client-server
system. There are three key parts:&nbsp; the server-side data management
system, the client-side GUI, and the network connection between the two.
<h3>
Non-Networked Mode</h3>

The program must be able to work in a non-networked mode. In this mode,
the database and GUI must run in the same VM and must perform no networking,
must not use loopback networking, and must not involve the serialization
of any objects when communicating between the GUI and database elements.
<p>The operating mode is selected using the single command line argument
that is permitted. Architecturally, this mode must use the database and
GUI from the networked form, but must not use the network server code at
all.
</p>
<h3>
Network Communication Approach</h3>

You have a choice regarding the network connection protocol. You must use
either serialized objects over a simple socket connection, or RMI.&nbsp;
Both options are equally acceptable.&nbsp; Keep in mind that networking
must be entirely bypassed in the non-networked mode.
<h3>
Restrictions on RMI</h3>

<li>
&nbsp;You must not require the use of an HTTP server.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;You must not require the installation of a security manager.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;You must provide all classes pre-installed so that no dynamic class
downloading occurs.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;You must use RMI over JRMP (do not use IIOP)</li>

<h2>
<a name="UI"></a>The User Interface</h2>

The user interface for this assignment must satisfy the following criteria:
<ul>

  <li>
It must be composed exclusively with components from the Java Foundation
Classes (Swing components).</li>

  <li>
It must allow the user to search the data for all records, or for records
where the number of guests and/or location fields exactly match values specified by
the user.</li>

  <li>
It must present search results in a JTable.</li>

  <li>
It must allow the user to book a selected record, updating the database
file accordingly.</li>

</ul>

Your user interface should be designed with the expectation of future functionality
enhancements, and it should establish a framework that will support this
with minimal disruption to the users when this occurs.

<h2>
<a name="database"></a>Server</h2>

<h3>Required Interface</h3>

Your data access class must be called "DataLayer.java", must be in a package
called "com.unitedcateres.db", and must implement the following interface:
<p></p>
<pre>package com.unitedcateres.db;<br>public interface DataBase<br>{<br>// Reads a record from the file.<br>// Returns an array where each element is a record value.<br>public String[] read(int recNo) throws RecordNotFoundException;<br><br>// Modifies the fields of a record. The new value for field n<br>// appears in data[n]. Throws SecurityException if the record<br>// is locked with a key other than lockkey.<br>public void update(int recNo, String[] data, String lockkey)<br>	throws RecordNotFoundException, SecurityException;<br><br>// Deletes a record, making the record number and associated<br>// data slot (row) available for reuse.<br>// Throws SecurityException if the record is locked with a key<br>// other than lockkey.<br>public void delete(int recNo, String lockkey)<br>	throws RecordNotFoundException, SecurityException;<br><br>// Returns an array of record numbers that match the specified<br>// criteria. Field n in the database file is described by<br>// criteria[n]. A null value in criteria[n] matches any field<br>// value. A non-null  value in criteria[n] matches any field<br>// value that begins with criteria[n]. (For example, "Queen"<br>// matches "Queen" or "Queens".)<br>public int[] find(String[] criteria);<br><br>// Creates a new record in the database (possibly reusing a<br>// deleted entry). Inserts the given data, and returns the record<br>// number of the new record.<br>public int create(String[] data) throws DuplicateKeyException;<br><br>// Locks a record so that it can only be updated or deleted by this client.<br>// Returned value is a string (lockkey) that must be used when the record is unlocked,<br>// updated, or deleted. If the specified record is already locked by a different<br>// client, the current thread gives up the CPU and consumes no CPU cycles until<br>// the record is unlocked.<br>public String lock(int recNo) throws RecordNotFoundException;<br><br>// Releases the lock on a record. lockkey must be the key<br>// that was returned when the record was locked; otherwise it throws SecurityException.<br>public void unlock(int recNo, String lockkey)<br>	throws RecordNotFoundException, SecurityException;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">//The following methods do not use lockkey (aka lock cookie) </span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">//as given in some assignments given by sun but are otherwise same as above</span><br><br>public <span style="font-weight: bold;">void</span> lockWithoutcookie(int recNo) throws RecordNotFoundException;<br><br>public void unlockWithoutcookie(int recNo)<br>	throws RecordNotFoundException, SecurityException;<br><br>public void updateWithoutcookie(int recNo, String[] data)<br>	throws RecordNotFoundException, SecurityException;<br><br>public void deleteWithoutcookie(int recNo)<br>	throws RecordNotFoundException, SecurityException;<br><br>}<br></pre>

<h2> <a name="data"></a> Data file Format</h2>

The format of data in the database file is as follows:
<p>
</p>
<ol>

  <li>The file starts with a 4 byte string that stores the data type id.
This id identifies this file as a data file for this application.
  </li>
  <li>An int stored in 4 bytes, that tells you the offset to the start of
record zero.
  </li>
  <li>A short stored in 2 bytes that tells you the number of fields in each record.
  </li>
</ol>

After the header information as specified above, the file stores the field descriptions.
For each field, it stores the following information:
<ol>

  <li>A short stored in 2 bytes that tells you the length in bytes of field name.
  </li>
  <li>Next n bytes (as defined by the previous entry) specify the field name.
  </li>
  <li>A short stored in 2 bytes that tells you the length of the  field in bytes.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After all the "meta" information above, Data section starts. Note that this
section starts from the offset that is specified in the header.
Each row of data is stored as per the schema described above. However, each
row is prepended with a 1 byte flag that specifies the status of the record.
0x00 implies valid record, 0xF0 implies deleted record.
</p>
<p>All numeric values stored in the header information use the formats
of the DataInputStream and DataOutputStream classes. All text values, and
all fields (which are text only), contain only 8 bit characters, null terminated
if less than the maximum length for the field. The character encoding is
8 bit US ASCII.
</p>
<h3>Database schema Used by United Caterers</h3>

The database files used by this application contains the following fields:
<table border="1">

  <tbody>
    <tr>

      <th>Field No.</th>

      <th>Field name in the database</th>

      <th>Field length</th>

      <th>Detailed description</th>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>1</td>

      <td>name</td>

      <td>32</td>

      <td>The name of the caterer.</td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>2</td>

      <td>location</td>

      <td>64</td>

      <td>The locality in which this caterer works</td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>3</td>

      <td>experties</td>

      <td>128</td>

      <td>Comma separated list of types of parties (eg. wedding, funeral, bachealor etc.)
this caterer services.</td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>4</td>

      <td>size</td>

      <td>2</td>

      <td>The number of people this caterer can service at a time.</td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>5</td>

      <td>price</td>

      <td>4</td>

      <td>Price per person for the party in USD.</td>

    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>6</td>

      <td>customerid</td>

      <td>8</td>

      <td>The customerid (an 8 lettered string) that identifies the customer who has
booked this caterer. An empty value means that this caterer has not been booked.
You should assume that the customer services reps know the customer ids and will use these
ids to while locking the records. Since the db file is also used by other custom applications,
this id is important to them but means nothing more than a regular field to this application.
      </td>

    </tr>

<h3>
Target Platform and Execution</h3>

Throughout this exercise, you must use exclusively the Java 2 platform.
You may develop your code using any implementation of the Java 2 platform,
but the submission that you return must have been tested and shown to work
under a production (not development) version of the Sun Microsystems' Java
2 platform and that platform must not have been superseded by a new production
version for more than 18 months by the time you make your submission.
<p>You are permitted to use any IDE tool you choose, but you must not submit
any code that is not your own work. The final program must have no dependencies
on any libraries other than those of the Java 2 Platform.
</p>
<p>When you submit your assignment, each part (client and server) must
be executable using a command of this exact form:
</p>
<blockquote><tt>java -jar &lt;path_and_filename&gt; [&lt;mode&gt;]</tt></blockquote>

Your programs must not require use of command line arguments other than
the single mode flag, which must be supported.&nbsp; Your programs must
not require use of command line property specifications. All configuration
must be done via a GUI, and must be persistent between runs of the program.
Such configuration information must be stored in a file called suncertify.properties
which must be located in the current working directory.
<p>The mode flag must be either "server", indicating the server program
must run, "alone", indicating standalone mode, or left out entirely, in
which case the network client and gui must run.
</p>
<p>You must not require manual editing of any files by the examiners.
</p>
<h3>
Packaging of Submissions</h3>

All elements of your submission must be packaged in a single JAR file.
The JAR file must have the following layout and contents in its root:
<ul>

  <li>
The executable JAR containing the programs. This must be called <tt>runme.jar</tt>.</li>

  <li>
The original, <i>unchanged</i> database file that was supplied to you.
  </li>

  <li>
A directory called <tt>code</tt>, containing all the source code and related
parts of your project. You must create subdirectories within this to reflect
your package structure and distribute your source files within those directories.</li>

  <li>
A file called <tt>version.txt.</tt> This must contain pure ASCII (not a
word processor format) indicating the exact version of JDK you used, and
the host platform you worked on.</li>

  <li>
A directory called <tt>docs</tt>, containing the following items at the
top level:</li>

  <ul>

    <li>
This html file.</li>

    <li>
A subdirectory called javadoc, containing HTML/Javadoc documentation for
all classes and interfaces you are submitting.</li>

    <li>
A file called <tt>choices.txt</tt> that containing pure ASCII (not a word
processor format) text describing the significant design choices you made.
Detail the problems you perceived, the issues surrounding them, your value
judgments, and the decisions that you made. This document should also describe
any uncertainties you had regarding the project, and the decisions you
made when resolving them.</li>

    <li>
User documentation for the database server and the gui client. If your
user documentation is online then you may omit this file. However, if the
documentation is not online, you must provide either a single plain ASCII
(not word processor format) text document, which must be called <tt>userguide.txt</tt>,
or multiple HTML files which must all be accessible from a starting point
document that must be called <tt>userguide.html</tt>.</li>

  </ul>

</ul>
